- **Auto-Cleanup**: Downloaded files are automatically deleted after upload
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays prevent hitting Telegram API limits
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging (check `/logs`)

## üîÑ Automatic Channel Forwarding

Set up continuous monitoring of channels with automatic forwarding:

1. **Configure** source and destination channels in `config.env`
2. **Enable** forwarding with `FORWARD_ENABLED=true`
3. **Monitor** with `/forward status` command
4. **Manage** with `/forward help` for detailed setup

The bot will automatically forward new posts from monitored channels while respecting the media-only filtering rules.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot access channel"**
- Ensure your user account is a member of the source channel
- For private channels, use channel ID instead of username
- Check if the channel exists and is accessible

**"No posting rights"**
- Verify you have permission to post in the target channel/group
- For channels: You need admin rights with "Post Messages" permission
- For groups: You need to be a member with posting rights

**"CHAT_FORWARDS_RESTRICTED"**
- Bot automatically handles this by using download+reupload method
- No action needed - the operation will continue seamlessly

**Rate Limiting**
- Bot has built-in delays and retry mechanisms
- Wait times are automatically handled
- Check `/logs` for detailed error information

## üìù Notes

- **Media Only**: Channel cloning specifically filters out text, captions, and audio to create clean media-only channels
- **Protected Channels**: Bot can clone from channels that restrict forwarding by downloading and re-uploading content
- **Universal Targets**: Supports any chat type - public/private channels, groups, supergroups
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient handling of large channel cloning with progress tracking
- **Background Processing**: Long operations run in background with periodic status updates
